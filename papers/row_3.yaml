Title: '"What do you want from theory alone?" Experimenting with Tight Auditing of
  Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation'
Short Description: Audits six implementations of DP synthetic data generative models
  using different datasets and threat models and finds that commonly used black-box
  MIAs are severely limited in power, yielding remarkably loose empirical privacy
  estimates. Considers MIAs in stronger threat models, i.e., passive and active white-box,
  using both existing and newly proposed attacks.
